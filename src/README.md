# Open-Transcribe (Web App)

This directory contains the Vite + React implementation that powers [open-transcribe.netlify.app](https://open-transcribe.netlify.app). It can be developed locally, tested, and deployed as a static site.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- (Optional) Playwright browsers if you plan to run end-to-end tests

## Installation & Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Microphone access requires accepting the browser prompt the first time you click **Start Recording**.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start the Vite dev server
- `npm run build` – produce the production bundle in `dist/`
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint on `src/`
- `npm run test` – execute unit tests (Vitest)
- `npm run test:watch` – watch mode for unit tests
- `npm run test:e2e` – run Playwright smoke tests (requires `npx playwright install`)
- `npm run check` – run lint + unit tests

## Project Structure

- `src/` – React components, hooks, services, and styles
- `tests/` – Vitest unit tests and Playwright e2e tests
- `dist/` – output directory created by `npm run build`
- `netlify/` – Netlify build metadata (if generated by CLI)

## Preferences Storage

`src/services/preferences.ts` persists model, prompt, and Gemini key in `localStorage` under the `open-transcribe.preferences` key. No server-side storage is used.

## Deployment

Netlify is configured for CI/CD at the repo root. From this directory you can run:

```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

Any static host that serves the `dist/` folder will work.

## Contributing

- Follow the repository eslint/prettier rules (`npm run lint`).
- Add or update Vitest/Playwright tests when changing behavior.
- Provide screenshots or notes for UI tweaks to help reviewers.
