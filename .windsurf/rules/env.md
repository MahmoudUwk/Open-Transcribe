Don't change the library google-genai, don't change the gemini API signature calls nor gemini model name. This is a new library and the generativeai is deprecated and does not work.
Use the .venv in the root project (gitignored you may not see it, but use it!).
Only stick to the requirements.txt !!!!!!
