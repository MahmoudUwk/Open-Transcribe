Hey everyone! 👋

Super excited to share something I've been working on: **Open-Transcribe**! 🎙️✨

If you're anything like me, you know how much of a pain it can be to transcribe audio manually. So, I built this free, open-source desktop app that lets you **directly record and transcribe on-the-fly** using Google's Gemini AI – no more saving and uploading files, ever!

**Here's why I think you'll find it super helpful:**

*   **It's totally FREE (seriously!):** No hidden fees, no subscriptions, and even the Gemini API key you need is free to grab. Plus, it's open-source, so feel free to check out the code or even contribute if you're up for it!
*   **Seamless On-the-Fly Transcription:** Just hit record in the app, speak, and get instant text! Super convenient for:
    *   **Meetings & Lectures:** Capture every word effortlessly.
    *   **Interviews:** Focus on the conversation, not the notes.
    *   **Personal Notes:** Dictate ideas and get them in text right away.
*   **Powered by Awesome AI:** It uses Google's Gemini AI, which means really accurate transcriptions, even across different languages.
*   **Your Privacy is Key:** This was super important to me. Your Gemini API key stays right on your computer and is *never* sent anywhere else. Your data is yours.

Ready to give it a try and make your life a little easier?
